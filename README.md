# GodotRuntimeInspector

<p>
A runtime inspector for the godot game engine.
</p>

<p>
I made this to learn about Dear ImGui[1], and godot.

This is currently a c# godot project, but I'll try to get it working as an addon so its eaiser to import, but for now, if you want to use it:

1) Install imgui-godot[2], (copy the addons folder to your project)

2) Add the files from this project to your own, the ui is created in Scripts/GodotRuntimeInspector.cs
